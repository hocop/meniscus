### How it works
1) You put your images in "images" folder. (examples are there already)
2) You run the code and see GUI window with trackbars and image window.
3) You change trackbar values until desired object is highlighted green.
4) You press "Submit" to write the X coordinate of object to file and proceed to next image.

### Requirements
Python2 with OpenCV and appjar:
```
pip install python-opencv
pip install appjar
```
